At the moment, we are only really at the start of an AI revolution. 
Applications like machine learning are still relatively new outside the big enterprises and have only been deployed as a very light touch. 
However, that said, many of the applications seem so normal that we donâ€™t even remember they exist. 
Talking to Alexa to turn on your lights has become standard in some households. 
In the future, the same will most likely happen with driverless cars and robotics but we are a little way off that yet.   


What is becoming quite scary is that humans are beginning to trust AI applications more than another human. 
In fact, even when in a retail store, over 60% of people surveyed said they would rather use their SmartPhone to answer questions than ask a human a
ssistant. As new technology like driverless cars come into play, this lack of trust could start a societal breakdown of sorts which is perhaps 
why we are holding back just a bit with such game changers.
