###  <a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in various industries from financial services to healthcare, law, education and retail. However, one that is sometimes left off the discussion to float under the radar is agriculture. 
Agriculture based firms are seeking to use AI technology to boost productivity and create a competitive advantage in the sector. Innovation is helping them to deliver new products and services and cement their place within a populated market. 
According to UN projections, food production is going to have to increase by as much as 70% with climate change, population growth and food security concerns. With that in mind, agriculture firms need to seek innovative solutions if they are to fulfil the demand. 
This article discusses some of the way in which AI is supporting the agriculture industry.

<a id="></a>Driverless vehicles

Autonomous vehicles have been talked about for a long time and there have been various public trials from companies like Uber and Tesla. Farming is also expected to benefit from driverless tractors. 
A driverless tractor will operate without human intervention and work continuously and efficiently based on a defined set of rules. This means farmers don’t have to take up their time carrying out the monotonous tasks and safety concerns around using equipment are negated. 
A supervisor will still need to monitor the progress at this stage until the technology advances again and some trials are considered remote controls.

<a id="ImageRecognition"></a>Image Recognition

Drone technology has started to be used for industrial purposes. Most off us will have heard how the technology is being piloted in delivering goods e.g. Amazon but there is also an opportunity within agriculture.
Drones can be used to take images of crops and monitor the production cycle at every stage. These images will be tagged and converted to data. That data can be used for making recommendations and decisions, exposing potential issues. For example, it might pick up on pests or irrigation problems that a farmer could be otherwise unaware of. 
Farmers can spend less time surveying their crops and more time thinking about production. In large farms, drones can scout much larger areas of land than humans could in a shorter time and more accurately. Drone technology will ultimately pay for itself quickly and is worth the initial investment.

<a id="BigData"></a>Big Data

Data is the essence of all things to do with agriculture. AI-based sensor equipment can be deployed which monitors temperature, soil conditions, rainfall or invasions over time. The data collected will be sent back to a processor and analysed. Cloud computing platforms have the ability to store and provide insight on incredibly large datasets. 
Using all of the information, farmers can be presented with the optimal time to grow their seeds so as to maximise production. This can improve return on investment and reduce the likelihood of wasted yield.
Sensors can also detect weeds and work out which herbicides need to be applied. The result of this is a reduction off toxins that find their way into food. 
Forecasting is integral within farming, especially in smaller countries where they don’t have as much knowledge or access to the right technology. The irony here is that these smaller farms are also responsible for as much as 70% of the world’s crops. If we are able to start predicting seasonality and weather patterns, the smaller farms can benefit from improved crops and continue to thrive. 

<a id="PrecisionFarming"></a>Precision Farming

Precision farming is the umbrella term used for methods involving AI, data and new technology.  It is best explained through the 4 R’s.
-	Right Source – matches the fertiliser type to crop needs
-	Right Rate – matches the amount of fertiliser to crop needs
-	Right Time – makes nutrients available when crops need them
-	Right Place – keep nutrients where crops can use them
The method relies on having the right technology in place to optimise agricultural health and productivity with a goal of sustaining and protecting the environment. It uses everything we have already talked about including drones, sensors and vast volumes of data. Precision farming used to be something only larger businesses would be able to deploy but mobile apps, cloud computing, edge computing and advanced infrastructures are starting to make it commonplace.

<a id="Robotics"></a>Robotics

Let’s face it, it is rare to find somebody who lists farming as their dream job. Traditionally, farms might be family owned businesses and plenty of people would live on or nearby the land. Today, that is not the case and there is a workforce shortage.
AI agriculture bots are being deployed to augment the human workforce. Bots are being used to harvest crops and can do so at a faster pace and for longer than humans have ever been able to. They can also identify weeds more accurately and reduce potential costs for the farm. 
Robots are being utilised within picking and packing areas that would have previously required manual labour as well. Again, they can do this faster than humans and work 24/7 meaning a far greater productivity rate. Hours of manual labour are eliminated.

<a id="CaseStudyNatureFreshFarms"></a>Case Study – NatureFresh Farms

Across almost 200 acres of greenhouses in Ohio and Ontario, NatureFresh Farms’ are a great example of using almost every facet of AI they have at their disposal. Robotic cameras are being used to collect images of plants and feeding the data through to algorithms that detect when they will be fully ripe vegetables. 
Sensors are measuring variables like temperature of the crops as well as the amount of water and fertiliser that it needs. Workers can simply adjust the settings using a smartphone app based on what the data recommends they do. This has reduced an hour of work into only 5 minutes. 
The same data is used to create forecasts for harvests and yield with scenarios adapted to potential climate changes. All food is tagged so that the end recipient knows exactly where it came from and can quickly respond if there is any problem with the crop. This will use technology similar to Blockchain which is perfect for picking up on contaminated food and already in operation within large supermarket chains.

<a id="Summary"></a>Summary

Without a doubt, AI is helping farms run more efficiently. Technology likes bots and drones can revolutionise efficiencies and productivity whilst ensuring more accurate decisions are made to optimise yields. With a demand for more food, investment in agricultural AI technology is important for the future and whilst change is tough, those in the sector need to start moving quickly.
