###  <a id="Overview"></a>Overview 

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 
Pattern is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. 

Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.


###  <a id="History"></a>History 

Patterns originated as an architectural concept by [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) (1977/79). 
In 1987, [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) 
and [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to 
programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented 
their results at the [OOPSLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOPSLA) conference that year.

In the following years, Beck, Cunningham and others followed up on this work.
Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the 
book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns_(book)) was published in 1994 
by the so-called **"Gang of Four"** (Gamma et al.), 
which is frequently abbreviated as **"GoF"**. 

###  <a id="Structure"></a>Structure

Description of design patterns are composed of several sections: (see § Documentation below). 
Of particular interest are the Structure, Participants, and Collaboration sections

**Pattern Name and Classification: A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying and referring to the pattern

**Intent:** A description of the goal behind the pattern and the reason for using it

**Also Known As:** Other names for the pattern

**Motivation (Forces):** A scenario consisting of a problem and a context in which this pattern can be used

**Applicability:** Situations in which this pattern is usable; the context for the pattern

**Structure:** A graphical representation of the pattern. Class diagrams and Interaction diagrams may be used for this purpose

**Participants:** A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design

**Collaboration:** A description of how classes and objects used in the pattern interact with each other

**Consequences:** A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern

**Implementation:** A description of an implementation of the pattern; the solution part of the pattern

**Sample Code:** An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language

**Known Uses:** Examples of real usages of the pattern

**Related Patterns:** Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns


Since standard structure can be complex for junior developer, this tutorial is trying to describe GoF Design Patterns on a simple way.

Each pattern is described using following triad:

**Understand:** describes a pattern with story from real life

**Implement:** referent implementation of the pattern

**Apply:** discuss where pattern can be(or is) applied

If you are a junior developer, and want to learn Design Patterns, this tutorial is the place to start.
If you are an intermediate or senior developer, and want to improve existing knowledge about Design Patterns, this tutorial can help you too.
