`yo` is the Yeoman command line utility which is used for creation of the projects 
templates, referred to as generators. 
Yo and the generators used are installed using npm.

First thing is to install `yo` using `npm`:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Now we are able to use Yeoman.

install node.js  
install npm  
install yo
